## The beginning
When I was 10 year old I play many games like Clash of clans *lol*. When I was playing I just thinked what if I made a game like this :eyes: I googled "How to make a game?" as i googled I just saw one thing called "Unity" and thats how I got interest in Developer

## Joined Discord
I joined a bunch of coding servers. "at this point I have looked into how to make games more" and I found this server called K.E.Y. i spoke with the owner bily, he is a great guy and said lets make a server! So I at the time not knowing how to code and one day bily said lets host a hackathon!! I said whats a hackathon? He said its a contest who can make the best game, website, etc I was sure I'm up for it and as stupid as I was I stole games code and stuff the day arrived and I showed him it and it had the copyright and the person that coded it's name and he was angry... But he teached me how to code and he still is to this day!!

## The code editor
I searched google for online editors then I found [repl.it](https://repl.it) :partying_face: I runned many codes there and everything got unsuccessfull. Then I started cloning the repo from [GitHub](https://github.com) :heart: and used [repl.it](https://repl.it) test the code. It worked first time then I started editing the codes inside of those javascript. Then it made me learn some new things like variables. I even made my own custom messages. After clonning and editing many repos I learned how to make a Discord bot online with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) <img src="https://www.phpexperttechnologies.com/cp-admin/dynamic_folder/blog_image/5d8c88533f72cnode-js-new.png" width="15px"> After some days [repl.it](https://repl.it) was not loading in my pc I just got `"Failed..."` something error. Then i tried to found another code editor then I found [Glitch](https://glitch.com) <img src="https://cdn.glitch.com/e200ca48-8caa-472f-b105-1ab0ed3d605d%2Fglitch-fish-big.png?v=1534344540198" width="15px">
